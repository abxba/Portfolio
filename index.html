                            <p>
                                Worked in a group of 8 people for a project course to create a cookbook
                                app that allowed a user to create, save, send, and receive recipes from 
                                other users. Extended requirements were added to the project as it progressed,
                                as the Teaching Assistants and Professors acted as our "clients" with whom we 
                                would have weekly presentations to showcase their desired application to them. 
                                It was required to work in the group according to the SCRUM project management 
                                guidelines and appoint a "Project Manager" every 2-3 weeks. This course was
                                8-weeks long, culminating in a presentation to our peers of the finished application.

                                Tasked with creating a terminal application using Java to create a registry 
                                system for a boat club. The system would allow the user to register members using 
                                a name and email address, and the new member would be assigned an ID number by
                                the system. Then members can register their boats based on the type of boat and
                                its subsequent measurements.

                            Object oriented
                            analysis and design course in which a final assignment included implementing certain 
                            rules and playing standards using java into a basic game of blackjack that we 
                            were provided. Our job was to make sure the rules implemented worked as they should,
                            along with creating unit tests for them.

                            Python: Required to create a binary search tree
                            and hashing function. In another course, we created a basic hash function
                            along with basic encryption/decryption methods using python to encrypt and decrypt 
                            our peers' messages in .txt files, and encrypting our own message. 
                            We were then asked to use our hash function and analyse its efficiency and 
                            redudancy using an avalanche test, and testing the distribution of 
                            the buckets.
