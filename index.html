                                Worked in a group of 8 people for a project course to create a cookbook
                                app that allowed a user to create, save, send, and receive recipes from 
                                other users. Extended requirements were added to the project as it progressed,
as the Teaching Assistants and Professors acted as our "clients" with whom we 
would have weekly presentations to showcase their desired application to them. 
It was required to work in the group according to the SCRUM project management 
guidelines and appoint a "Project Manager" every 2-3 weeks. This course was
8-weeks long, culminating in a presentation to our peers of the finished application.
